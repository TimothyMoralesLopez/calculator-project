This is my calculator project. In this project, I will utilize everything I've learned so far in this curriculum. I am anxious to get to the part where I will have to style the interface using CSS, as that is truly my weakest area. However, I am confident I can get through it and push through to get the project complete. There are also a few components of the actual calculator itself that look intimidating at the moment, but I'm sure that breaking the whole project up into smaller more manageable pieces will serve me well here. 

This is my calculator project - completed! This project was a lot less CSS focused than I had anticipated. However, the logic behind the numbers and having it work like an actual calculator that allows you to evaluate expressions with either the "=" button or by pushing another operator button was a struggle for me. However, I was eventually able to get there. I am just worried because I am sure my code is very clunky and cluttered and not efficient at all. So I hope to go back to this project afterwards to fix it up. I hope to be obtain the knowledge soon to be able to fix it.
